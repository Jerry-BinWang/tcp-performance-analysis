Like in experiment 1, use run.py to tun all the experiments and store results in different trace files. multi-run.py
is used to run one experiment with the same parameters (except for the difference in CBR start time and TCP start time
which is generated randomly) multiple times. significance.py and significance.R are used to evaluate the statistical
significance of our experiment results.
