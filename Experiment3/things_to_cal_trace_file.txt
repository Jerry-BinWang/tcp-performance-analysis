Things to calculate from the trace file:
1. Number of packets send from a src node
2. Among those, number of packets received at dstn node
3. Number of packets dropped using 1,2 and separately.
4. Latency for each packet and then average latency over all the packets.


Graphs needed in Exp3: all graphs for both RED and DropTail
1. TCP and CBR throughput vs time for DropTail
2. TCP and CBR throughput vs time for RED
3. TCP - Latency vs packet# for DropTail
4. TCP - Latency vs packet# for RED
5. TCP and CBR - cwind vs time
6. TCP and CBR Bandwidth vs time
7. TCP - Packet drop vs time

all for reno and sack
